Clothes Shop- (written in java- Android).
I built a mobile app that contains:
1. Three activities: Main Activity,Men activity and women activity (connected via intent).
2.List view in each activity, attached with an Adapter.
3. in each list view: onclick item shows a dialog that contains information of the specific selected item(price ,image etc.), on long click the item will be removed from the list.
4.Each activity has a toolBar that includes a menu, in the menu : *you can click on exit to exit the activity/the app.
                                                                *you can click on settings, a preferences screen shows
5. Preferences screen includes many options: clearing data, saving deleted items in shared preferences,BroadCast reciever that changes the Preferences switch when the user changes the Wifi button in Android.
6.In Main activity, when clicking on All items you can view both women and men items( not sorted).
7. when clearing data in a certin activity(men or women) it will not affect the deleted items in the other activity.
8.Parser that parses an Xml file located in Assets foler to load data into the ListView.
